# ecp5-BlinkyLED
Blinking LED on Lattice ECP5 FPGA. Inspiration for the implementation comes from kholia/Colorlight-5A-75B. The code from rst_gen.v is from their repo. The initial version of blink.v was also from their repo but was changed to eliminate the use of rst_gen.v, since at the time I couldn't figure out what it was for. Right now I'm working on controlling an LED matrix.
